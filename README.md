# TSLA_Stock_WebAPP
I built this Stock Trend Prediction Web Application for TESLA using Python, Yahoo Finance and Streamlit. 

Teslaâ€™s stock price is predicted using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model.

Disclaimer: The LSTM model cannot be used to predict stock prices in real life because the stock market is highly unpredictable. In this project, the validation phase is used to test the model's performance. The purpose of this project is for learning.


<h1> DataSet: </h1>
The dataset used in this project is Tesla stock's history (From 2010 - May 2023).
I pulled this Data Using Yahoo Finance's API.

### import yfinance as yf

<h1> Libraries used </h1>

* Pandas
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib 
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow

<h1> Objective </h1>

Objective of this Project is to analyse the stocks of Tesla co and perform data visualization for better understanding. Then, implement Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the Tesla Stocks.
